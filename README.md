# AES-128 implementation in C++

Code for encrypting payload given a 128-bit key.

Program accepts input written in binary format: first 16 bytes correspond to the encryption key, followed by 16-byte-blocks which represent the payload.

Example files:
- aes_sample.in 	// input file
- aes_sample.out 	// output for the example
