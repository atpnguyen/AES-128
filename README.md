# AES-128 implementation in C++

Code for encrypting payload given a 128-bit key.

Program accepts input written in binary format: first 16 bytes correspond to the encryption key, followed by 16-byte-blocks which represent the payload.

Example files:
- aes_sample.in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// input file
- aes_sample.out &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// output for the example
